    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Student Grievance System main goal is to provides services for arrived problems of students 
    to the teachers/ HOD /principal. Nowadays there are many students facing problems but they hesitate to 
    share their problems with their teachers directly and freely and so to overcome this problem we decided 
    to make such a website for students through which they can express their problems related to fees, study, 
    admission etc. freely without directly contacting with their teachers as hiding their identities and that 
    can be resolved by teachers/HOD/principals as early as possible. The Grievance system will also look into matters of ragging.<br><br>

    among all the students in order to maintain a harmonious educational atmosphere in the institute.
